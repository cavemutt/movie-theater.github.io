# movie-theater.github.io

This is a practice website based on a local movie theater using HTML, CSS, Javascript along with some GSAP.

Starting with a loose design made in Figma, it became a playground for different things that I wanted to try.
The goal was to figure out how to things to work together on a larger project as opposed to small isolated projects.
As it grew, I soon learned how valuable it would've been to plan everything out ahead of time.

This was designed with the site's audience in mind, incorporating fun interactions and animations while keeping a hollywood vibe.

This site is responsive to different devices via several media queries (again, more detailed planning would've helped here).
The layout changes to look good on screens from 320px wide to 4k. Further testing is needed and welcomed, however.

There is a cinematic opening animation screen with animations for the hero section entering afterwards.
The food items wiggle on hover and each play an appropriate audio clip when clicked.

On most screen sizes, navigation is available in the hero section and a top nav appears on scroll. 
Smaller sizes have a burger and side menu.
The section in view is highlighted in the top and side navs, and the side nav closes when an option is chosen.

Scroll animations are scattered throughout for interest, and clickable mascots also appear with an appropriately themed joke.
Popcorn pops up as you scroll and responds subtley to mouse and fnger drag movement.

The movie theater image also serves as a trailer player with friends of the theater in the audience, which adds a little dimension with a head image layered in front of the screen. 

A modal with details Future Events opens on a click of the events calendar.
The menu image enlarges as a modal when clicked.

Cursors and scrollbars are customized, though the trailing star is on my list of things to re-think.

A Non-working email signup form and a comment/question form are available in the Contact section.
A carousel slide show is available in the About section, as well as some merchandise mock-ups at the bottom of the page.

Things to work on with this site is to have different devices test and give feedback.
The opening animations might be wonky on different devices, which might need some work.
The Contact forms would be fully functional if deployed as a working website,
and carousel photos would be replaced with originals.
If used as a real site, the basic styling and positioning could be reworked to reduce some of the media queries,
GSAP flip might be added for some smoother animation movements, and
much more attention would be paid towards accessibility, especially for screen readers. (yet again, pre-planning is gooood)

Thank you for taking a look, and Enjoy!
