# movie-theater.github.io

This is a practice website based on a local movie theater using HTML, CSS, Javascript along with some GSAP.

Starting with a loose design made in Figma, it became a playground for different things that I wanted to try.
The goal was to figure out how to get things to work together on a larger project as opposed to small isolated projects.
I soon learned how valuable it would've been to plan everything out ahead of time, as it became a mish-mash monster.

This was designed with the site's audience in mind, incorporating fun interactions and animations while keeping a hollywood vibe.

This site is responsive to different devices via several media queries (again, more detailed planning would've been smart on my part!).
The layout changes to look good on screens from 320px wide to 4k. Further testing is needed, however, a full reboot of the coding plans would be the next step.

What you will find on the website :
There is a cinematic opening animation screen with animations for the hero section entering afterwards. I've found this to have issues loading on some devices.

The food items wiggle on hover and each play an appropriate audio clip when clicked.

On most screen sizes, navigation is available in the hero section and a top nav appears on scroll. 
Smaller sizes have a burger and side menu.
The section in view is highlighted in the top and side navs, and the side nav closes when an option is chosen.

Scroll animations are scattered throughout for interest, and clickable mascots also appear with a themed "dad" joke.

Popcorn pops up as you scroll and responds subtley to mouse or finger drag movement.

The movie theater image also serves as a trailer-player, with friends of the theater in the audience. A little dimension is added with a head image layered in front of the screen. 

A modal with details Future Events opens on a click of the events calendar.
The menu image also enlarges as a modal when clicked.

Cursors and scrollbars are customized, though the trailing star is on my list of things to re-think(I find it a little annoying).

A (not-connected) email signup form and a comment/question form are available in the Contact section.

A carousel slide show is available in the About section, as well as some merchandise mock-ups at the bottom of the page.

Things to work on : 
Have different devices test and give feedback.
The opening animations are wonky on different devices and need some work.
The Contact forms would be fully functional if deployed as a working website,
and carousel photos would be replaced with originals.
If used as a real site, the basic styling and positioning could be reworked to reduce some of the media queries,
GSAP Flip would be better than plain GSAP for some smoother animation movements, and
much more attention would be paid towards accessibility, especially for screen readers. (yet again, pre-planning is gooood)

Thank you for taking a look, and Enjoy!
